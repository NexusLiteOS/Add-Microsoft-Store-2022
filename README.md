FAQ's
-----------------------------------------------
I. How to download?
- In order to download it, head onto the releases tab on your browser & download the latest version which is v1.00.
- If you're on desktop, the releases tab is in the right side of your display. If you're on mobile, scroll down or find the "releases" section in the Github app.

II. How to install?
- Extract the .zip & run the .bat, simple enough no?

III. Will this get more updates?
- I may not do so, considering the 1st version is natively working already + Updatable to the Newest UI.

IV. NOTE
- Considering people are trying to download the .zip through Code (The Green Button) then download as .zip, you won't be able to get the installer working since the .appx's is larger than Github's 25MB Limit. (The file is 70MB+)
